Helps with getting item builds and runes for League of Legends
Asks for the champion you are playing and pulls up the probuilds.com page on that champion and from there it shows builds, runes and specific players.
Some champions require full names and others have abbreviations shown in the prompt. 

Not super advanced or groundbreaking, just wanted to help a litte with items and runes if someone needs help.
